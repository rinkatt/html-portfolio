<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a teacher, a writer, a mother, and so much more!</p>

<p>I have worked as an educator for nearly 15 years, and currently teach Kindergarten.
  I love my Kinders very much! I also, in whatever spare time I have, write. I have about 40 chapters written in a novel I hope to publish soon.
</p>

<p>But my family is #1. My husband is Korean, and loves to travel, always planning wonderful trips for us. 
  My son, Jack, is a super sweet little boy who always favors the villains and absolutely cracks me up.
