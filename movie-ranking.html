<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>This movie based on Jane Austen's most popular novel is one of my absolute favorites. Make sure to watch the one with Keira Knightley.</p>

<h3>Beauty and the Beast</h3>
<p>My favorite Disney movie! Belle is a book nerd, very much like me.</p>

<h3>Pirates of the Carribean</h3>
<p>The first one only. This movie should have been a stand alone!</p>
